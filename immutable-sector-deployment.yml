The Deployment "ds-important-1" is invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: {"matchLabels":{"app":"ds-important","id":"ds-important","uuid":"18426a0b-5f59-4e10-923f-c0e078e82462"}}: field is immutable


This error occurs when you try to modify the selector field of an existing Deployment, which is immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

Understanding the Error
spec.selector: Invalid value: ... field is immutable
What happened:

You have an existing Deployment named ds-important-1
You tried to change its .spec.selector.matchLabels
Kubernetes does not allow changing selectors after a Deployment is created
The selector is permanently locked at creation time


Why Selectors Are Immutable
The selector defines which Pods belong to the Deployment. If it could change:

Existing Pods would become "orphaned"
New Pods would have different labels
Deployment would lose track of its Pods
Chaos would ensue!

Immutable fields in Deployments:

.spec.selector
.metadata.name (obviously)


kubectl delete deployment ds-important-1
